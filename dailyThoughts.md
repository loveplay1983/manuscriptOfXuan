1. We are human beings, therefore, both sorrow and joy ought to be there. the fact is you have to learn how to control it, move on, shine others instead of being illuminated by others.   

   To be the person who can shine others as the sun shines in the universe is what should be following.

   To live is to find the truth, which is to be a good entity. 

   That's simple, we are chasing our final destiny that is to be someone - a good man. 

   The Question is how can we find the reasonable definition of being a good man. 

   It is perplexed sometimes since the context differs.
