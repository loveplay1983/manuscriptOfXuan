* We are human beings, therefore, both sorrow and joy ought to be there. the fact is you have to learn how to control it, move on, shine others instead of being illuminated by others.   

  To be the person who can shine others as the sun shines in the universe is what should be following.

  To live is to find the truth, which is to be a good entity. 

  That's simple, we are chasing our final destiny that is to be someone - a good man. 

  The Question is how can we find the reasonable definition of being a good man. 

  It is perplexed sometimes since the context differs.



* To live is to grow, without learning and creating, everything is boring. 



* First, it is rather crucial to point out, the primary goal is to maintain a healthy body while reducing the body weight, therefore, sufficient nutrition must be taken place, in other words, one ought to eat regularly instead of cutting down the amount of food that he or she used to take. The tricky part is to filter out high calorie while absorbing the fiber-rich food. 

  Second, self-discipline, one of the most important aspects. One must start exercising and make it into a daily habit. Take, for example, beginning with 1 mile jogging, and then 2 miles, 3 miles, gradually increase the # of miles. Do not rush, do not hesitate.

  Third, but not the last, keep listening to motivational speech, reading tons of books, in order to help you running through all the difficulties. 

  There are many more items in the toolkit of weight loss, these are the 3 major I have been practicing this far. Remember, people and things in the past can be remembered, but please don't look back.

  

* One of my friends told me: "One must be conscious of the decision of life. " 

  "The paradox is we will grow only after those mistakes which form the integrity of all lives."

  Please moving forward
