* We are human beings, therefore, both sorrow and joy ought to be there. the fact is you have to learn how to control it, move on, shine others instead of being illuminated by others.   

  To be the person who can shine others as the sun shines in the universe is what should be followed.

  To live is to find the truth, which is to be a good entity. 

  That's simple, we are chasing our final destiny that is to be someone - a good man. 

  The question is how can we find a reasonable definition of being a good man. 

  It is perplexed sometimes since the context differs.

  我们是人，所以悲伤和快乐都应该在那里。 事实是你必须学会如何控制它，继续前进，照亮别人，而不是被别人照亮。

  做一个能像太阳照耀宇宙一样照耀别人的人，才是应该遵循的。Bruce lee once said, "Martial arts is the way of expressing the arts of human body"; And to my mind, "Writing is the path to observe one's mind and spirit"

  活着就是要找到真相，就是做一个好人。

  这很简单，我们正在追逐我们最终的命运，那就是成为某个人——一个好人。

  问题是我们如何才能找到一个合理的解释来定义一个好人。

  由于所处环境的不同，有时会感到困惑。



* To live is to grow, without learning and creating, everything is boring. 

  活着就是成长，没有学习和创造，一切都是枯燥乏味的。



* First, it is rather crucial to point out, the primary goal is to maintain a healthy body while reducing body weight, therefore, sufficient nutrition must be taken place, in other words, one ought to eat regularly instead of cutting down the amount of food that he or she used to take. The tricky part is to filter out high calories while absorbing the fiber-rich food. 

  Second, self-discipline, one of the most important aspects. One must start exercising and make it into a daily habit. Take, for example, beginning with 1-mile jogging, and then 2 miles, 3 miles, gradually increasing the # of miles. Do not rush, do not hesitate.

  Third, but not the last, keep listening to motivational speeches, reading tons of books, in order to help you run through all the difficulties. 

  There are many more items in the toolkit of weight loss, these are the 3 majors I have been practicing this far. Remember, people and things in the past can be remembered, but please don't look back.

  首先需要指出的是，减肥的首要目标是保持健康的体魄，因此，一定要做到营养充足，也就是说，应该规律饮食，而不是减少食物的摄入量。 棘手的部分是在吸收富含纤维的食物的同时过滤掉高热量。

  第二，自律，最重要的方面之一。 一个人必须开始锻炼并使其成为一种日常习惯。 例如，从 1 英里慢跑开始，然后是 2 英里、3 英里，逐渐增加英里数。 不要着急，不要犹豫。

  第三，但不是最后，继续听励志演讲，阅读大量书籍，以帮助您度过所有困难。

  减肥工具集里包含的内容还有很多， 这三个方面是目前主要的练习。 记住，过去的人和事可以记住，但请不要回头。

* One of my friends told me: "One must be conscious of the decision of life. " 

  "The paradox is we will grow only after those mistakes which form the integrity of all lives."

  Please moving forward !!! 😇

  我的一位朋友告诉我：“一个人必须时刻觉察自己的人生决定。”

  “矛盾的是，只有在经历那些构成所有生命完整性的错误之后，我们才会成长。”

  请保持前进！！！😇



* One lives with a true peaceful mindset inside would never seek happiness from outside, which is ironic for those who are looking for a calm moment and harmony by extra activities - listening, learning, and sometimes physical training, because the pleasure, joyfulness, delight is already there.

  内心真正拥有平静的人永远不会从外部寻求幸福，这对于那些通过额外的活动（聆听、学习，有时甚至是体育锻炼）寻求平静与和谐的人来说具有讽刺意味。

  It is a little bit contradicting for things that we used to understand, the fact is, we are, living under the same dome which is full of collisions. 

  对于我们过去所理解的概念来说有点矛盾，事实是，我们生活在同一个充满碰撞的穹顶之下。

* Living to us is piano-playing do to the player, we strike the keys passionately for miscellaneous music genres. The fact is, one must keep playing until the fingers fall off before taking a bow.

  生活对我们来说就像钢琴演奏对演奏者一样，我们为各种音乐流派热情地敲击琴键。 事实是，在谢幕之前，必须一直弹奏直到手指脱落。

* "It may be important to great thinkers to examine the world, and despise it.
  But I think it is only important to love the world, not to despise it, not for us to hate each other, but to be able to regard the world and ourselves and all beings with love, admiration, and respect. "

  对伟大的思想家来说，如何审视这个世界似乎是重要的事情。
  但我认为，重要的是爱这个世界，而不是去讨厌它，非互相憎恨，而是能够以爱、钦佩之情和尊重来看待这个世界，我们自己以及所有芸芸众生。

* Melodies, songs, there exist a great many, people always didn't comprehend the connotation; 
  Recollection, nostalgia, intertwining with convoluted emotions, they start to realize the implication;
  Past, now, and future, the entity of the timeline, yet it is not straight, rather Gaussian. People observe us through a "cdf", whereas the "pdf" is where the truth lies. "

* My new idea: People say, "It is hard to be a good man, but easier to be in a certain type of indulgence", I have translated to another version, I flip it upside down. I would say, "It is rather a simple task to achieve a good person, due to the fact that one does not need too much effort to reach it, you may not rich, but at least you can manipulate the attitude to others, the relationship is under your control; On the other side, to approach an evil mind is of course very easy thing, but it is somewhat anti-human, we are human beings :) "

  我的新想法：人们总说，“做一个好人很难，某种形式的放纵似乎更容易”，我已经翻译成另一个版本，我把它颠倒过来了。 我会说：“成为一个好人是一件相当简单的事，因为一个人不需要太多的努力便可以达到，你可能并不富有，但至少你可以选择与别人相处的态度， 一切在你的控制之下；另一方面，接近某种邪恶的思想当然是件容易的事情，但它有点反人类啊，我们是人类不是吗:)”

* "Once you hit a certain age you become permanently unimpressed by a lot of shit."

  "一旦你到了某个年龄段，你将对许多曾经的趣事永远都不再感兴趣。"

* What one could do yesterday, does not mean a second chance in another day, one must do whatever could be done when youth; What one has today does not mean you shall own it in the next day, one ought to be living in the present; What has not happened yet, does not mean it is not going to occur in the future; so therefore, we behoove to  seize the time, grasp the moment, store resources, and polish the skills, ready for whatever may come, when things are coming, one will act rapidly, and appropriately without redundancy, which it often comes from over thinking.

  “A good martial artist does not become tense, but ready. Not thinking, yet not dreaming. Ready for whatever may come. When the opponent expands, I contract; and when he contracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity, “I” do not hit, “it” hits all by itself.”  --Bruce Lee

  

  “昨天能做的，不代表日后有第二次机会，年轻时能做的就必须去做； 一个人今天拥有的，不代表第二天就拥有它，一个人应该活在当下； 还没有发生的事情，不代表以后不会发生； 所以，我们应该抓紧时间，把握时机，资源储备，磨练本领，做好万全之策，当有事情发生之际，行动迅速，得体，不拖泥带水，这往往来自于过度思考。“　 - 宣雄民

  “一个好的武者不会让自己变得紧张，而是时刻都准备好了。 没有过度思索，也没有做白日做梦。 为可能发生的一切做好准备。 对手前进，我退守； 当他退守时，我便前进。 当有机会时，“我”不打，“它”自己打（拳）。”　- 李小龙

* "I think of learning to cook is equivalent of learning to program in some extent. First, you need to recognize the ingredients which is corresponding to the fundamental of coding, such as variables, statement structure, etc.; Then, you observe how others do beforehand, it points to the mimicking of coding from other programmers; After that, it is time to get your hands dirty, the initial experiences will yield real trouble for you, just like the newbie programmer would make unexpected errors which sometimes is weird, or disasters for your computer system; And lastly, as you maintain a regular practicing of such, you move toward a real experienced cook eventually, so is a programmer. "

  "我认为学习烹饪在某种程度上相当于学习编程。 首先，你需要认识素材成分，这正对应了编程中的基础，如变量、语句结构等； 然后，你先观察别人是怎么做的，即模仿其他程序员的编码； 在那之后，是时候动手了，最初的经验会给你带来真正的麻烦，就像新手程序员会犯一些意想不到的错误，有时很奇怪，或者对你的计算机系统造成灾难； 最后，当你保持定期练习时，你最终会成为一名真正有经验的厨师，程序员也是如此。"
